clear all; % clears all variables from the Workspace
close all; % closes all open figures
clc; % clears the history of commands entered in the Command Window

% Gets a list of connected ports and 
% saves it to L
L = serialportlist;

% Save the last item on that list 
Port = L(end)
% Typically the most recently connected
% component is last on that list, 
% which is probably your Redboard

% You can change this value to see what it does
X = 10;

% Connect to the Arduino
A = arduino(Port,'Uno')
% This will take a few minute the 
% first time it connects to your Arduino.
% If you don't have a board connected, 
% you'll get an error which is fine. 
% You should still submit your script


% Blink Pin 13 X times increasing in rate
for s = 1:X
    i=(1/(2*s));
    A.writeDigitalPin('D13',1);
    pause(i);
    A.writeDigitalPin('D13',0);
    pause(i);
    disp("Blinked");
