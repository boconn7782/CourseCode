% This function connects to the course database table
% for this assignment and adds your student information
% and selected Avenger from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
% It extracts a table where each row is the timestamp for
% the student's first successful upload to the database and
% their favorite avenger, returning it to the program as
% the function's output. 
% These will eventually be saved as pcode to limit new
% content for the students as well as help protect the
% database and the individual tables.

%% Create Connection to the database
% Uses an external function to secure database information

%% Uploading Individual Datapoint

% Write the post to the database.

    % In this case, the error is a possible duplicate entry. 
    % Try/catch with a Warning is used to keep that error from
    % stopping the script since we'll just update instead.
